### (Construction of a videoconsole and development of the 25 ‘Snakes’ it contains)

Construction of a Snake videoconsole and exploration of the creative method that allowed for its 25 alternative game modes to be conceived and developed:
based on the thorough analysis of the rules by which the game is defined, and the systematic breaking and reimagining of these rules, 25 "new" games (grouped in 7 types depending on the kind of rules they breached) were originated and programmed into the console.
